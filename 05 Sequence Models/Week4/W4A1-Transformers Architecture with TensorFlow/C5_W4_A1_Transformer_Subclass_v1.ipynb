Positional Encoding\n","\n","In sequence to sequence tasks, the relative order of your data is extremely important to its meaning. When you were training sequential neural networks such as RNNs, you fed your inputs into the network in order. Information about the order of your data was automatically fed into your model.  However, when you train a Transformer network using multi-head attention, you feed your data into the model all at once. While this dramatically reduces training time, there is no information about the order of your data. This is where positional encoding is useful - you can specifically encode the positions of your inputs and pass them into the network using these sine and cosine formulas:\n","    \n","$$\n","PE_{(pos, 2i)}= sin\\left(\\frac{pos}{{10000}^{\\frac{2i}{d}}}\\right)\n","\\tag{1}$$\n","<br>\n","$$\n","PE_{(pos, 2i+1)}= cos\\left(\\frac{pos}{{10000}^{\\frac{2i}{d}}}\\right)\n","\\tag{2}$$\n","\n","* $d$ is the dimension of the word embedding and positional encoding\n","* $pos$ is the position of the word.\n","* $i$ refers to each of the different dimensions of the positional encoding.\n","\n","To develop some intuition about positional encodings, you can think of them broadly as a feature that contains the information about the relative positions of words. The sum of the positional encoding and word embedding is ultimately what is fed into the model. If you just hard code the positions in, say by adding a matrix of 1's or whole numbers to the word embedding, the semantic meaning is distorted. Conversely, the values of the sine and cosine equations are small enough (between -1 and 1) that when you add the positional encoding to a word embedding, the word embedding is not significantly distorted, and is instead enriched with positional information. Using a combination of these two equations helps your Transformer network attend to the relative positions of your input data. This was a short discussion on positional encodings, but develop further intuition, check out the *Positional Encoding Ungraded Lab*. \n","\n","**Note:** In the lectures Andrew uses vertical vectors, but in this assignment all vectors are horizontal.

Similarly, for sequences shorter than the maximum length, they zeros will also be added for padding. However, these zeros will affect the softmax calculation - this is when a padding mask comes in handy! You will need to define a boolean mask that specifies which elements you must attend(1) and which elements you must ignore(0). Later you will use that mask to set all the zeros in the sequence to a value close to negative infinity (-1e9). We'll implement this for you so you can get to the fun of building the Transformer network! 😇 Just make sure you go through the code so you can correctly implement padding when building your model. \n","\n","After masking, your input should go from `[87, 600, 0, 0, 0]` to `[87, 600, -1e9, -1e9, -1e9]`, so that when you take the softmax, the zeros don't affect the score.\n","\n","The [MultiheadAttention](https://keras.io/api/layers/attention_layers/multi_head_attention/) layer implemented in Keras, use this masking logic."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":10,"metadata":{"id":"JOL9XWsFQxxo","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1661397088387,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":10,"user":{"displayName":"Chongru Huang","userId":"18381363077608980034"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["def create_padding_mask(decoder_token_ids):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Creates a matrix mask for the padding cells\n","    \n","    Arguments:\n","        decoder_token_ids -- (n, m) matrix\n","    \n","    Returns:\n","        mask -- (n, 1, 1, m) binary tensor\n","    \"\"\"\n","    seq = 1 - tf.cast(tf.math.equal(decoder_token_ids, 0), tf.float32)\n","    # print(seq.shape)\n","\n","    # add extra dimensions to add the padding\n","    # to the attention logits.\n","    return seq[:, tf.newaxis, tf.newaxis, :] "]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":11,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"5J5FFjklQ1Fz","outputId":"044483f0-26af-4341-8d87-3807f98dd2a5","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1661397088387,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":10,"user":{"displayName":"Chongru Huang","userId":"18381363077608980034"}}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["tf.Tensor(\n","[[[[1. 1. 0. 0. 1.]]]\n","\n","\n"," [[[1. 1. 1. 0. 0.]]]\n","\n","\n"," [[[0. 0. 0. 1. 1.]]]], shape=(3, 1, 1, 5), dtype=float32)\n"]}],"source":["x = tf.constant([[7., 6., 0., 0., 1.], [1., 2., 3., 0., 0.], [0., 0., 0., 4., 5.]])\n","print(create_padding_mask(x))"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"xQzOnLttxsh5"},"source":["If we multiply (1 - mask) by -1e9 and add it to the sample input sequences, the zeros are essentially set to negative infinity.
